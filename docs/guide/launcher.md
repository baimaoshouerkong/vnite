# Launcher

Vnite supports launching games in three ways: files, links, and scripts, and provides various preset configurations.

## Presets

### Default Configuration

Directly generates launcher configuration from the bound game path, suitable for games that can be launched directly through executable files.

### LE Region Launch

Requires binding the LE path in settings, can generate scripts for launching with LE region conversion.

### Steam Launch

Requires providing the Steam game ID, can wake up Steam to open the game.

### VBA Emulation Launch

Requires binding the VBA path in settings, can generate scripts for launching with VBA emulation.
