# Save Files

Vnite has designed a save file management system, making it convenient for players to backup, switch, and mark save files. These operations can be performed in the `Game-Save Files` page.

The default maximum number of save file backups is 7, which can be modified in `Game-Settings-Properties-Path`. You can prevent automatic cleanup of save files by locking them.
