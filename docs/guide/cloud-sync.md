# Cloud Sync

Thanks to the powerful synchronization capabilities of PouchDB and CouchDB, Vnite's database natively supports real-time cloud synchronization across multiple devices, and comes with an official server and account system, providing each user with a 300MB synchronization quota.

Of course, you can still choose to self-host CouchDB, which works out of the box. Please refer to the following documentation.
