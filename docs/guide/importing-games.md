# Import from Third-party Platforms

Vnite currently supports importing your game library from Steam, with support for more platforms coming in the future.

## Steam

Importing your game library from Steam will preserve your game time, but your library needs to be public.
Steam ID can be obtained from the URL of your personal profile, example: https://steamcommunity.com/profiles/73561139761149479/ where `73561139761149479` is the Steam ID.
