Vnite can integrate with other visual novel related software, such as the region conversion tool Locale Emulator, to enhance the player's gaming experience.

## Locale Emulator

After installation, you need to bind the path of `LEProc.exe` in Vnite's `Settings-Advanced-Integration-Locale Emulator`.

Then, for games that need to be launched with LE region conversion, select `LE Region Launch` in the game's `Settings-Properties-Run-Preset Configuration` to generate a preset.
