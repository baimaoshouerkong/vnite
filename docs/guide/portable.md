# Portable Mode

Vnite supports portable mode, which can be enabled in `Settings-Database`.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> If the directory where Vnite is located is protected by the system, such as `C:\Program Files\vnite`, Vnite in portable mode will request administrator privileges to support write operations
